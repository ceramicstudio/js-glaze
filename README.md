**js-idx** is a JavaScript/TypeScript library for building applications with decentralized identity and user-centric data.

IDX provides high-level APIs for interacting with various decentralized identity standards implemented on the Ceramic network such as 3ID DIDs, Identity Indexes, user profiles, open social graphs, and more. IDX is compatible with all blockchains, wallets, and a wide variety of user and application data storage options including Ceramic, Textile, OrbitDB, Filecoin, IPFS, Secure Data Stores, and more  – so you can seamlessly integrate decentralized identity with the rest of your Web3 tech stack. IDX allows you to build much more sophisticated and powerful Web3 applications that rival and even exceed what's currently possible on Web2.
