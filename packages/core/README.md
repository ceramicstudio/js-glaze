## IDX: An identity protocol for open applications

IDX is a cross-platform identity protocol that replaces centralized user tables with a decentralized alternative. IDX allows users to build up a unified digital identity consisting of all their data while enabling developers to break down silos and freely share a users' data between applications. IDX supports all application architectures, but is notably compatible with all blockchains, wallets, and user/application datastores.

- **Eliminate users from your server**: Replace centralized user IDs and user tables with a secure decentralized alternative
- **Connect many accounts**: Link multiple blockchain, web3, social network accounts, and domains to the same user identity
- **Use any datastore**: Store user and application data in any DB server, blockchain, or Web3 datastore
- **Make your data discoverable**: Add references to your data to a user’s personal index, where it can be discovered by others
- **Import data from other apps**: Discover a user's entire catalog of data by querying the index and import it into your app
- **Give users control**: Give users control over data discovery, sharing, and permissions
