title: What is an Index?
slug: /concepts/index

In IDX, the index document is a key-value store for associating and discovering data and resources for a DID. It is the critical component which enables interoperability and portability of user information across domains or applications.

The index document contains a list of mappings from data definitions to references for all data associated with a given DID. The index document is owned by a DID and the DocID of the index is registed in their DID document. In IDX, index documents are stored on the Ceramic Network.

The complete technical specification for IDX indexes can be found [here](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/master/CIPs/CIP-11/CIP-11.md).
