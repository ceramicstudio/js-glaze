title: What is a Schema?
slug: /concepts/schema
---

In IDX, a **schema** is a document created by a developer which describes a JSON schema. A schema is included in a [definition](core-concepts-definitions.md) to describe the structure of data found in a corresponding [reference](core-concepts-references.md). Because IDX uses Ceramic for storing schemas and references, schemas can be used to validate and enforce the structure of a reference.


Well-known schemas may be defined in [Ceramic CIPs](), other specifications, or created by developers for their application needs.
