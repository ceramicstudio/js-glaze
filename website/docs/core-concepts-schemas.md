title: What is a Schema?
slug: /concepts/schema
---

In IDX, a **schema** is a document created by a developer which describes a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/). A schema is included in a [definition](core-concepts-definitions.md) to describe the structure of data found in a corresponding [reference](core-concepts-references.md). Because IDX uses [Ceramic](core-concepts-ceramic.md) for storing schemas and references, schemas can be used to validate and enforce the data structure of a reference.

Well-known schemas may be defined in [Ceramic CIPs](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/cip), other specifications, or created by developers for their application needs.
