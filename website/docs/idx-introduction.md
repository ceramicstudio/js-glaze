## Welcome to IDX!

IDX is a library used to interact with Ceramic Root Indexes as defined in the [Root Index CIP](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/issues/21).

The [Root Index](idx-terminology.md#root-index) is essentially a **key-value store** [Document](idx-terminology.md#document) published to the [Ceramic network](idx-terminology.md#ceramic) and meant for discovery of resources associated to a [Decentralized Identifier (DID)](idx-terminology.md#did).
